# With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:

# x = 1 
# print(x)
# while x < 6:
#     if x == 3:
#         break
#     x += 1
#     print(x)


#  Using 'continue' skips over the designated value and continues the loop.  

# The 'else' statement performs some funtionality once the loop is broken.
